# Lending Cinema Avatar

Welcome to Lending Cinema Avatar project! This repository houses code and resources for a platform designed to facilitate lending and borrowing of avatars for virtual cinemas.

## Overview

In virtual environments like online cinemas, avatars serve as representations of users. Our platform aims to enhance the user experience by providing a lending system for avatars. Users can borrow avatars temporarily for various purposes, such as attending virtual events, socializing, or representing themselves differently for specific contexts.

## Features

- **Avatar Repository**: A centralized repository storing various avatars available for lending.
- **Lending System**: Functionality allowing users to borrow avatars for defined periods.
- **User Profiles**: Profiles for users to manage their borrowed avatars, lending history, and preferences.
- **Notification System**: Alerts and reminders for upcoming avatar returns or overdue borrowings.
- **Search and Filtering**: Tools for users to discover avatars based on categories, tags, or popularity.
